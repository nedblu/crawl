## Crawl CMS

Crawl is a simple CMS (Content Management System) to ease the life of professionals whom do not have the knowledge of programming. For us NedBlu it is important to achieve the concept ‘easy to use’ because we believe people deserve to be happy and enjoy their website how ever it best suits them.

## Technical Aspects

This project is based on Laravel 4, a beautiful framework for artisans. Our main goal is for our clients to have the security and docile accessibility to manage their website. Therefore, we are working hard to achieve our goals using the security that Laravel provides. Documentation for the entire framework can be found on the [Laravel website](http://laravel.com/docs).
